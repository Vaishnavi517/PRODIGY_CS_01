The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on. When the end of the alphabet is reached, it wraps around to the beginning.
